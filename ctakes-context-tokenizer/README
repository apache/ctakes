Introduction
############

This annotator creates annotations from one or more tokens, using surrounding tokens as clues. 
An example of an annotation created from multiple tokens is a range that includes 2 numbers 
and a dash (e.g. 2-3).

See the CdtTypeSystem.xml descriptor for the list of annotation types this annotator might create.  

This annotator depends on finite state machine (FSM) code in the project named core.

ContextDependentTokenizerAnnotator.xml

The analysis engine descriptor has no parameters.
Include this analysis engine in your pipeline if you wish to have the following annotations created
  DateAanotation
  FractionAnnotation
  MeasurementAnnotation
  PersonTitleAnnotation
  RangeAnnotation
  RomanNumeralAnnotation
  TimeAnnotation


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TestTAE.xml  

The TestTAE descriptor is an aggregate analysis engine that can be used to run a short pipeline
that takes plaintext as input and annotates for tokens, sentences, and for the annotations created
by this context dependent tokenizer annotator:
  DateAanotation
  FractionAnnotation
  MeasurementAnnotation
  PersonTitleAnnotation
  RangeAnnotation
  RomanNumeralAnnotation
  TimeAnnotation
 
This aggregate does not override any parameters or resource bindings.
